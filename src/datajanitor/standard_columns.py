def standardize_columns(df):
    """
    Cleans column names by making them consistent.

    This function standardizes column names by removing extra spaces,
    converting all characters to lowercase, and replacing spaces with
    underscores. Doing this helps avoid bugs caused by inconsistent
    column naming in downstream analysis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pandas.DataFrame
        Input DataFrame whose column names will be standardized.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        A copy of the input DataFrame with standardized column names.
